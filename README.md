# Groovy Gorillas

Since [Ubuntu 20.10 declared its codename would be "Groovy Gorilla"](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/04/ubuntu-20-10-codename-groovy-gorilla), clearly this calls for an updated version of the legendary [GORILLA.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)), a game created in QBasic in 1991 and which holds a special place in the heart of everyone who wrote code as a kid back then. Al Sweigart excellently [reimplemented the game in PyGame](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2010/06/25/gorillaspy-a-remake-of-gorillasbas/) in 2010, and now to celebrate Ubuntu 20.10 Groovy Gorilla, we make those gorillas... Groovy!
